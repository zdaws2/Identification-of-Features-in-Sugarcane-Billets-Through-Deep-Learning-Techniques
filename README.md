# Identification-of-Features-in-Sugarcane-Billets-Through-Deep-Learning-Techniques

The following project aims to successfully collect an extensive array of data using photography with an RGB camera capturing multiple samples of sugarcane billets. Training data evaluation had to successfully derive from models through data annotations within bounding boxes and polygons. The main priority was to train a successful multi-feature classification model meeting a benchmark with an AP50 higher than 70% to produce a model that suitability identifies quality features within sugarcane billets with high confidence and accuracy. Once successful training occurred, the model's implementation within a practical system had to occur within a live sugar mills conveyor belt at Sunshine Sugars Condong Mill. Finally, to deliver statistical results through machine vision python scripts to identify Sound, Damaged, and Mutilated billets according to SRA quality guidelines. Therefore, allowing parties involved to make informed decisions based on meaningful data.
